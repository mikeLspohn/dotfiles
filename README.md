# New Dotfiles

When I started my original dotfiles I had no clue what I was doing. Granted they work,
but it is a lot of copy/pasted stuff from various resources online.

With a new laptop I had a chance to start fresh so I started from the ground up!

_this currently is only tests on osx_

## Things to install outside of this repo to get working

  * Powerline fonts for osx (this helps with powerline symbol display)
  * iTerm2 or another terminal replacement with xterm-256 color support
  * Homebrew (optional but helps install other packages easier)
  * Tmux
  * Vim 8+ (probably already installed)
  * xcode developer tools for git + more usage on osx
  * oh-my-zsh (https://ohmyz.sh/)
  * vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  * nvm (node version manager)
